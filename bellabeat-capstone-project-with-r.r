Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with\nknowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly\npositioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n\n**1) ASK**\n\n**Questions For the Analysis**\n\n**1.** What are some trends in smart device usage?  \n\n**2.** How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?  \n\n**3.** How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n**Business Task**\n\nBased on smart device usage, identifying the opportunities for company's growth and giving marketing strategy decisions, using non-Bellebeat consumer data and then apply these insights to one Bellabeat product in our presentation.\n\n**Key Stakeholders**\n\n*  Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n*  Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team\n*  Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and  \n   reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.\n\n**2) PREPARE**\n\n* **About the data**\n\n[FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](http://https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set\ncontains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of\npersonal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes\ninformation about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.\n\n* This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.\n\n* **Data organization and verification**\n\nThe dataset includes 18 csv files. Each files has quantitative data tracked by the fitbit. Every user has unique ID and tracked by multiple rows in different time stamps.\n\n**3) PROCESS**\n\nI will perform my analysis in R due to the accessibility and amount of data. I will create visualizations from my findings to share with the stakeholders.\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# First of all , we need to install packages that we are going to use in this analysis\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(janitor)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-09T13:54:05.498049Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-09T13:54:05.500826Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-09T13:54:05.521955Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* **In this analysis, I will only focus on daily_activity and daily_sleep and weight information for each user data**\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Uploading files from the dataset\n\ndaily_activity <- read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv\")\ndaily_sleep <- read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv\")\nweight <- read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-09T13:54:05.570115Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-09T13:54:05.571684Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-09T13:54:05.811795Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Checking our data and general information about tables\n\nhead(daily_activity)\nglimpse(daily_activity)\nstr(daily_activity)\n\nhead(daily_sleep)\nglimpse(daily_sleep)\nstr(daily_sleep)\n\nhead(weight)\nglimpse(weight)\nstr(weight)\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-09T13:54:05.815023Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-09T13:54:05.816857Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-09T13:54:06.001703Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Identifying number of unique users in each table\n\nn_unique(daily_activity$Id)\nn_unique(daily_sleep$Id)\nn_unique(weight$Id)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-09T13:54:06.005611Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-09T13:54:06.008943Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-09T13:54:06.04613Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> In this case we have different sample size, but we will still keep the weight table to perform separate outputs","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Identifying duplicates for each table\n\nsum(duplicated(daily_activity))\nsum(duplicated(daily_sleep))\nsum(duplicated(weight))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-09T13:54:06.048947Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-09T13:54:06.050539Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-09T13:54:06.089428Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Removing duplicated values from our tables\n\ndaily_activity <- daily_activity %>%\ndistinct() %>%\ndrop_na()\n\n\ndaily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>%\ndistinct() %>%\ndrop_na()\n\nweight <- weight %>%  # We did not removed NA values from this table because in fat column there are many NA values, wanted to keep them\ndistinct()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-09T13:54:06.091955Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-09T13:54:06.093385Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-09T13:54:06.116023Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Verfying duplicated values in daily_sleep table\n\nsum(duplicated(daily_sleep))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-08-09T13:54:06.118513Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-08-09T13:54:06.120153Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-08-09T13:54:06.140071Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Above table inspection we have seen that there are some inconsistency in column names.
