# Cyclistic Bike share project
Google Analytics Capstone Project

The bike sharing company wants to make decisions on their customers and products by using Fitbit Tracker Data to find the main differences in behaviour between their two types of users, the “casual” who pays for each ride and the annual member who pays a yearly subscription to the service.

The company wants to improve their earnings reaching out to their “casual” riders, and for that they have to analyze in what aspects the “casual” and the annual customers differ, to be able to create a focused and successful marketing message to the “casual” customers that makes them change to the annual subscription.
